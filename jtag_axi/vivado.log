Categories: 
Hardware

Description:

  Define a read or write transaction for the JTAG to AXI Master core, hw_axi
  object, specified by the get_hw_axis command.

  The JTAG to AXI Master is a customizable IP core that works as an AXI
  Master to drive AXI transactions and drive AXI signals that are internal to
  the hardware device. The JTAG-AXI core supports all memory-mapped AXI
  interfaces, except AXI4-Stream, and supports the AXI-Lite protocol.
  Detailed documentation on the IP core can be found in the LogiCORE IP JTAG
  to AXI Master Product Guide (PG174) .

  AXI transactions are read/write burst transactions from the JTAG to AXI
  Master core onto AXI signals connected to the core. The AXI transaction
  lets you configure aspects of the read or write transaction such as the
  data to send and the address to send it to. These defined transactions are
  stored as properties of the specified hw_axi object, waiting to be run and
  reported using the run_hw_axi and report_hw_axi_txn commands.

  The command returns the name of the hw_axi_txn object created, or returns
  an error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -address <arg> - (Optional) Specify the address of the register on the
  hw_axi object to read from, or write into. Default address 0000.

  -data <arg> - (Optional) The data value specified in hexadecimal format to
  write into the address location of the hw_axi for WRITE transactions. The
  default data value is all zeros.

  -type [ READ | WRITE ] - (Required) Specify the AXI transaction to READ
  from the specified address, or WRITE into it.

  -len <arg> - (Optional) The length of the READ or WRITE transaction,
  specified as the number of data words to read or write, based on the -size
  option. The default is 1.

  -burst <arg> - (Optional) The type of AXI bursts to perform. Bursts can be
  specified as INCR, FIXED, or WRAPPED. The default data burst is incremental
  (INCR).

  -cache <arg> - (Optional) The AXI command cache to implement, specified in
  decimal form. The default value is 3. For more information on read/write
  cache settings refer to the LogiCORE IP Product Guide: JTAG to AXI Master
  (PG174).

  -id <arg> - (Optional) The ID to assign to the AXI transaction, specified
  in decimal form. This lets the tool identify responses to various read and
  write transactions.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <name> - (Required) The name to give to the newly created AXI transaction
  object. This name can be used to access or recall the transaction.

  <hw_axi> - (Required) The hw_axi object to define the transaction for. The
  hw_axi must be specified as an object returned by the get_hw_axi command,
  and can not simply be specified by name.

Example:

  The following example specifies a WRITE transaction, with a data value of
  decimal 10 specified as a hexadecimal value, to be written in a 2 data word
  transaction for 32-bit data words:

    create_hw_txn write_1 -type WRITE -data 0000_0000_0000_000A -size 32 -len 2 \ 
    [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1]

  The following example creates a new hardware AXI transaction object,
  hw_axi_txn, which writes the specified 128 bit data stream into the
  specified address of the hw_axi object. The new AXI transaction is named
  write_txn:

    
    create_hw_axi_txn write_txn [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] -type WRITE \ 
    -len 4 -data {44444444_33333333_22222222_11111111}

  This example creates AXI read and write transactions, runs the hw_axi, and
  reports on the results:

    create_hw_axi_txn wr_txn [lindex [get_hw_axis] 0] -address 80000000 \ 
    -data {11112222 33334444 55556666 77778888} -len 4 -type write 
    create_hw_axi_txn rd_txn [lindex [get_hw_axis] 0] -address 80000000 \ 
    -len 4 -type read 
     
    run_hw_axi [get_hw_axi_txns wr_txn] 
    set wr_report [report_hw_axi_txn wr_txn -w 32] 
    puts $wr_report 
     
    run_hw_axi [get_hw_axi_txns rd_txn] 
    set rd_report [report_hw_axi_txn rd_txn -w 32] 
    puts $rd_report 
     
    close_hw_target; 
    disconnect_hw_server;

  This example creates a sequence of READ type hw_axi transactions, and then
  runs them:

    
    # Read registers 
    create_hw_axi_txn -address [format %08x [expr $baseaddr + \ 
       $MM2S_VDMACR_OFFSET]] -type read txn00 [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] 
    create_hw_axi_txn -address [format %08x [expr $baseaddr + \ 
       $MM2S_VDMASR_OFFSET]] -type read txn01 [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] 
    create_hw_axi_txn -address [format %08x [expr $baseaddr + \ 
       $MM2S_REG_INDEX_OFFSET]] -type read txn02 [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] 
    create_hw_axi_txn -address [format %08x [expr $baseaddr + \ 
       $PARK_PTR_REG_OFFSET]] -type read txn03 [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] 
    create_hw_axi_txn -address [format %08x [expr $baseaddr + \ 
       $VERSION_OFFSET]] -type read txn04 [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] 
    create_hw_axi_txn -address [format %08x [expr $baseaddr + \ 
       $S2MM_VDMACR_OFFSET]] -type read txn05 [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] 
    create_hw_axi_txn -address [format %08x [expr $baseaddr + \ 
       $S2MM_VDMASR_OFFSET]] -type read txn06 [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] 
    create_hw_axi_txn -address [format %08x [expr $baseaddr + \ 
       $S2MM_VDMA_IRQ_OFFSET]] -type read txn07 [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] 
    run_hw_axi -quiet [get_hw_axi_txns]

INFO: [Labtools 27-1434] Device xc7z045 (JTAG device index = 1) is programmed with a design that has no supported debug core(s) in it.
WARNING: [Labtools 27-3123] The debug hub core was not detected at User Scan Chain 1 or 3.
Resolution: 
1. Make sure the clock connected to the debug hub (dbg_hub) core is a free running clock and is active OR
2. Manually launch hw_server with -e "set xsdb-user-bscan <C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN scan_chain_number>" to detect the debug hub at User Scan Chain of 2 or 4. To determine the user scan chain setting, open the implemented design and use: get_property C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN [get_debug_cores dbg_hub].

INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:axi_bram_ctrl:4.0-2] test_ip: In IP Integrator, please note that memory depth value gets calculated based on the Data Width of the IP and Address range selected in the Address Editor.Incase a validation error occured on the range of this parameter, please check if the selected Data width and the Address Range are valid. For valid Data width and memory depth values, please refer to the AXI BRAM Controller Product Guide.
INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:axi_bram_ctrl:4.0-1] test_ip: In IP Integrator, The Maximum address range supported is 2G. Selecting the address range more than 2G in the address editor may resets the value of Memory depth to default value (1024). please refer to the AXI BRAM Controller Product Guide.
