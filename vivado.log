WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.

INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:axi_bram_ctrl:4.0-2] test_ip: In IP Integrator, please note that memory depth value gets calculated based on the Data Width of the IP and Address range selected in the Address Editor.Incase a validation error occured on the range of this parameter, please check if the selected Data width and the Address Range are valid. For valid Data width and memory depth values, please refer to the AXI BRAM Controller Product Guide.
INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:axi_bram_ctrl:4.0-1] test_ip: In IP Integrator, The Maximum address range supported is 2G. Selecting the address range more than 2G in the address editor may resets the value of Memory depth to default value (1024). please refer to the AXI BRAM Controller Product Guide.

WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.
