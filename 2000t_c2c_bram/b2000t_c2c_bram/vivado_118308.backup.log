WARNING: [Constraints 18-549] Could not create 'SLEW' constraint because cell 'IOBUF_inst' is not directly connected to top level port. 'SLEW' is ignored by Vivado but preserved inside the database. [/home/wesleyguo/github/vivado/vivado/ip/dut/jack_120/jack/jack.srcs/sources_1/imports/sources_1/jack_120.v:31]
Resolution: It is recommended to apply the I/O constraint directly to the top level port instead of applying the constraint to the cell connected to the port.
