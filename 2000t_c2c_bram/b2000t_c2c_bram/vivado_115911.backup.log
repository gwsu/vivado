WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.

To synchronize the hw_probes properties and the VIO core outputs choose one of the following alternatives:
  1) Execute the command 'Commit Output Values to VIO Core', to write down the hw_probe values to the core.
  2) Execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core', to update the hw_probe properties with the core values.
  3) First restore initial values in the core with the command 'Reset VIO Core Outputs', and then execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core'.

WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.

WARNING: [Labtools 27-1952] VIO hw_probe OUTPUT_VALUE properties for hw_vio(s) [hw_vio_1] differ from output values in the VIO core(s).
Resolution: 
To synchronize the hw_probes properties and the VIO core outputs choose one of the following alternatives:
  1) Execute the command 'Commit Output Values to VIO Core', to write down the hw_probe values to the core.
  2) Execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core', to update the hw_probe properties with the core values.
  3) First restore initial values in the core with the command 'Reset VIO Core Outputs', and then execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core'.

  1) Execute the command 'Commit Output Values to VIO Core', to write down the hw_probe values to the core.

For valid Data width and memory depth values, please refer to the AXI BRAM Controller Product Guide.
INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:axi_bram_ctrl:4.0-1] test_ip: In IP Integrator, The Maximum address range supported is 2G. Selecting the address range more than 2G in the address editor may resets the value of Memory depth to default value (1024). please refer to the AXI BRAM Controller Product Guide.

WARNING: [Labtools 27-1952] VIO hw_probe OUTPUT_VALUE properties for hw_vio(s) [hw_vio_1] differ from output values in the VIO core(s).
Resolution: 
To synchronize the hw_probes properties and the VIO core outputs choose one of the following alternatives:
  1) Execute the command 'Commit Output Values to VIO Core', to write down the hw_probe values to the core.
  2) Execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core', to update the hw_probe properties with the core values.
  3) First restore initial values in the core with the command 'Reset VIO Core Outputs', and then execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core'.

Resolution: 
To synchronize the hw_probes properties and the VIO core outputs choose one of the following alternatives:
  1) Execute the command 'Commit Output Values to VIO Core', to write down the hw_probe values to the core.
  2) Execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core', to update the hw_probe properties with the core values.
  3) First restore initial values in the core with the command 'Reset VIO Core Outputs', and then execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core'.

WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.

WARNING: [Labtools 27-1952] VIO hw_probe OUTPUT_VALUE properties for hw_vio(s) [hw_vio_1] differ from output values in the VIO core(s).
Resolution: 
To synchronize the hw_probes properties and the VIO core outputs choose one of the following alternatives:
  1) Execute the command 'Commit Output Values to VIO Core', to write down the hw_probe values to the core.
  2) Execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core', to update the hw_probe properties with the core values.
  3) First restore initial values in the core with the command 'Reset VIO Core Outputs', and then execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core'.

Resolution: 
To synchronize the hw_probes properties and the VIO core outputs choose one of the following alternatives:
  1) Execute the command 'Commit Output Values to VIO Core', to write down the hw_probe values to the core.
  2) Execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core', to update the hw_probe properties with the core values.
  3) First restore initial values in the core with the command 'Reset VIO Core Outputs', and then execute the command 'Refresh Input and Output Values from VIO Core'.

WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.

WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.

WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.
